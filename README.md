# Python
This Hotel Management System project, developed using Python, Tkinter, and OpenPyXL, provides a user-friendly graphical interface to manage hotel room bookings and food orders efficiently. The system allows users to input customer details, select room types, and choose food items. It calculates the total cost, including service tax, and saves the transaction details into an Excel file for easy record-keeping and data management. This project is a practical solution for small to medium-sized hotels looking to streamline their operations and maintain organized records.
